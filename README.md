Here are some of the projects I've created using Python, showcasing my coding skills and problem-solving abilities:
1) Tic Tac Toe 🎮
A simple two-player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. Features basic game logic and user interaction.

2) Simple Calculator ➕➖✖️➗
A console-based calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3) Rock Paper Scissors ✊✋✌️
A classic game against the computer with randomized outcomes and score tracking for an interactive experience.

These projects were built using only Python, focusing on fundamentals without relying on external libraries or frameworks. Feel free to explore the code in the respective repositories!
